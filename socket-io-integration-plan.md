# Socket.IO Integration Plan for Backend App

## 1. Setup and Configuration

1. ✅ Install Socket.IO:
   ```
   npm install socket.io
   ```

2. ✅ Import and initialize Socket.IO in the main app file (e.g., `app.js` or `server.js`):
   - Import Socket.IO
   - Create a Socket.IO instance attached to the HTTP server

3. ✅ Configure CORS for Socket.IO if needed

## 2. Event Handlers

1. ✅ Create a new file `socketHandlers.js` to organize Socket.IO event handlers
2. ✅ Implement handlers for events such as:
   - Connection/disconnection
   - Joining/leaving rooms (e.g., for specific vendor support queries)
   - Sending/receiving messages

## 3. Integration with Existing Routes ✅

1. ✅ Modify the `createSupportQuery` function in `controllers/vendor-support-query.js`:
   - Emit a 'newSupportQuery' event when a new query is created

2. ✅ Modify the `markQueryAsRead` function:
   - Emit a 'queryMarkedAsRead' event when a query is marked as read

## 4. Authentication and Authorization

1. ✅ Implement authentication for Socket.IO connections
2. ✅ Ensure that only authorized users can join specific rooms or receive certain events

## 5. Error Handling

1. ✅ Implement error handling for Socket.IO events
2. ✅ Log errors and emit appropriate error events to clients

## 6. Testing

1. Write unit tests for Socket.IO event handlers
2. Implement integration tests to ensure proper communication between server and clients

## 7. Documentation

1. ✅ Update API documentation to include information about real-time features
2. ✅ Document new events and their payloads

## 8. Performance Considerations

1. ✅ Implement room-based communication to minimize unnecessary broadcasts
2. Consider using Redis adapter for horizontal scaling if needed in the future

## 9. Deployment

1. Update deployment scripts to account for Socket.IO
2. Ensure proper configuration for production environment (e.g., SSL for secure WebSocket connections)

## Next Steps

After reviewing and approving this plan, we can proceed with the implementation of each step, starting with the setup and configuration of Socket.IO in the main app file.
